# Development Log

This file is append-only.
Do not modify or delete previous entries.

Timestamp: 2026-03-23 10:11 local

User Request:
Follow the repository's mandatory append-only logging workflow before any meaningful implementation work.

Codex Plan:
- Read `AGENTS.md` and the existing `docs/dev-log.md` contents before any edits.
- Append a new entry to `docs/dev-log.md` without modifying prior content.
- Treat `docs/dev-log.md` as the only intended file to touch for this step unless a later task requires more files.
- Validate compliance by confirming the new entry is appended at the end and prior log content remains unchanged.

Actions Taken:
- Read `AGENTS.md`.
- Read `docs/dev-log.md`.
- Appended this planning entry to `docs/dev-log.md`.

Outcome:
Logging requirements were reviewed and the required planning entry was appended before any code or config changes. No implementation changes have been made yet.

Notes:
If a later task requires code or config changes, a new append-only entry will be added first if the plan materially changes.

User Request:
Commit `AGENTS.md` and the `docs` folder, then push the commit to the configured remote.

Codex Plan:
- Inspect git status to confirm which changes under `AGENTS.md` and `docs/` are currently present.
- Create a commit that includes the requested repository files without rewriting prior history.
- Push the new commit to the current remote branch.
- Intended files to touch: `docs/dev-log.md` for this planning entry, plus git metadata through staging, commit, and push operations.
- Expected validation: verify `git status --short`, confirm the new commit with `git log -1 --stat`, and ensure `git push` succeeds.

Actions Taken:
- Read `AGENTS.md`.
- Read `docs/dev-log.md`.
- Appended this planning entry to `docs/dev-log.md`.

Outcome:
Planning for the requested commit and push has been recorded. Git staging, commit creation, and push have not been run yet.

Notes:
If push fails because of remote permissions, branch protection, or network restrictions, that failure will be reported after attempted validation.

User Request:
Commit `AGENTS.md` and the `docs` folder, then push the commit to the configured remote.

Codex Plan:
- Record the actual git actions and validation results after attempting the requested commit and push.
- Preserve append-only logging by adding a new entry instead of changing the earlier planning entry.
- Note the remaining blocker if remote publication cannot be completed from the current environment.

Actions Taken:
- Ran `git status --short`, `git diff --cached --stat`, and `git log -1 --stat --oneline` to validate staged and committed content.
- Ran `git add AGENTS.md docs`.
- Ran `git commit -m "Add agent instructions and development log"`.
- Ran `git push origin main`.

Outcome:
Created commit `c07b526` containing `AGENTS.md` and `docs/dev-log.md`. The push to `origin/main` failed with `fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': Device not configured`, so the commit exists locally but is not published to the remote.

Notes:
The remaining step is remote authentication or remote reconfiguration, then rerunning `git push origin main`. The unrelated untracked file `excalidraw.log` was not included in the commit.

Timestamp: 2026-03-23 10:24 local

User Request:
Retry the git push now that remote authentication has been fixed.

Codex Plan:
- Check the working tree to confirm which changes need to be committed before retrying the push.
- Stage and commit the appended `docs/dev-log.md` entry created after the earlier push failure.
- Push the local `main` branch to `origin` and verify the remote update succeeds.
- Intended files to touch: `docs/dev-log.md` for this planning entry, plus git metadata through staging, commit, and push operations.
- Expected validation: verify `git status --short`, confirm the new commit with `git log -1 --stat --oneline`, and ensure `git push origin main` succeeds.

Actions Taken:
- Read `AGENTS.md`.
- Read `docs/dev-log.md`.
- Appended this planning entry to `docs/dev-log.md`.

Outcome:
Planning for the push retry has been recorded. Staging, commit creation, and the new push attempt have not been run yet.

Notes:
The unrelated untracked file `excalidraw.log` should remain excluded unless explicitly requested.

User Request:
Add new workflow instructions to `AGENTS.md` and use the provided take-home PDF as context for an RFC-first approach without writing code yet.

Codex Plan:
- Update `AGENTS.md` with the requested constraints: stay simple, do not write code until instructed, keep responses concise, store RFCs in `docs/rfc`, and store execution plans in `docs/plans` with numeric prefixes.
- Read the provided case study PDF to gather context for the upcoming RFC work.
- Avoid implementation changes beyond documentation and process updates in this step.
- Intended files to touch: `docs/dev-log.md` for this planning entry and `AGENTS.md` for the workflow instructions.
- Expected validation: verify the appended log entry, inspect the updated `AGENTS.md`, and confirm no code files were changed.

Actions Taken:
- Read `AGENTS.md`.
- Read `docs/dev-log.md`.
- Appended this planning entry to `docs/dev-log.md`.

Outcome:
Planning for the documentation-only workflow update and case study review has been recorded. No repository instructions or code have been changed yet beyond this new log entry.

Notes:
The next artifact after aligning on process should be an RFC under `docs/rfc`, followed later by numbered execution plans under `docs/plans`.

User Request:
Add new workflow instructions to `AGENTS.md` and use the provided take-home PDF as context for an RFC-first approach without writing code yet.

Codex Plan:
- Record the documentation updates and case study review in a new append-only log entry.
- Preserve the earlier planning entry and describe the completed actions in a separate follow-up entry.
- Keep the repository in a documentation-only state with no implementation work started.

Actions Taken:
- Read `/Users/ninadsindu/Downloads/Case study - Staff Engineer for Growth.pdf` with `pdftotext -layout`.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` to add working style and deliverable workflow instructions.
- Verified the updated `AGENTS.md` contents with `sed -n '1,260p' AGENTS.md`.

Outcome:
`AGENTS.md` now instructs future work to avoid over engineering, proceed step by step, avoid writing code until explicitly requested, keep responses concise, place RFCs in `docs/rfc`, and place numbered execution plans in `docs/plans`. The case study context is reviewed and ready for RFC drafting.

Notes:
The case study centers on an abandoned cart recovery system with event tracking, identity stitching, re-engagement scheduling, transactional safety interlocks, high-scale resilience, and experimentation support. No code has been written.

Timestamp: 2026-03-23 10:35 local

User Request:
Brainstorm the high-level technical approach before drafting the RFC for the abandoned cart recovery system.

Codex Plan:
- Synthesize the case study into a simple first-pass architecture suitable for an RFC.
- Focus on scope, system boundaries, core data flow, and the minimum mechanisms needed to satisfy safety and scale requirements.
- Avoid implementation details and code, since this step is for alignment only.
- Intended files to touch: `docs/dev-log.md` only for this planning entry.
- Expected validation: confirm the new log entry is appended and produce a concise high-level approach for discussion.

Actions Taken:
- Read `AGENTS.md`.
- Read `docs/dev-log.md`.
- Appended this planning entry to `docs/dev-log.md`.

Outcome:
Planning for the RFC brainstorming step has been recorded. No RFC file has been created yet and no code changes have been made.

Notes:
This discussion should converge on a simple initial architecture that can later be written up in `docs/rfc`.

User Request:
Decide whether the recovery scheduler should support configurable urgency levels and send strategies beyond the example timing buckets in the task.

Codex Plan:
- Clarify how to keep the initial design simple while leaving room for future scheduling variants.
- Recommend an RFC position that separates policy configuration from scheduling execution.
- Avoid expanding scope into implementation details or premature complexity.
- Intended files to touch: `docs/dev-log.md` only for this planning entry.
- Expected validation: confirm the new log entry is appended and provide a concise recommendation for the RFC.

Actions Taken:
- Read `AGENTS.md`.
- Read `docs/dev-log.md`.
- Appended this planning entry to `docs/dev-log.md`.

Outcome:
Planning for the scheduler flexibility design discussion has been recorded. No RFC file or code has been changed.

Notes:
The recommendation should preserve a narrow prototype while preventing the RFC from hardcoding a single recovery strategy forever.

Timestamp: 2026-03-23 10:45 local

User Request:
Draft the first RFC for the abandoned cart recovery system, review it iteratively later, and push the draft to the remote.

Codex Plan:
- Write a first-pass RFC in `docs/rfc` that captures the scalable target architecture, operational requirements, rollout approach, and the distinction between long-term system design and a later MVP demo build.
- Keep the RFC high level and decision-oriented, not implementation-heavy.
- Stage the documentation changes, create a commit, and push the draft to `origin/main`.
- Intended files to touch: `docs/dev-log.md` for this planning entry, `docs/rfc/*` for the RFC draft, and git metadata for commit and push operations.
- Expected validation: verify the RFC content locally, confirm the staged diff and latest commit, and ensure `git push origin main` succeeds.

Actions Taken:
- Read `AGENTS.md`.
- Read `docs/dev-log.md`.
- Appended this planning entry to `docs/dev-log.md`.

Outcome:
Planning for the first RFC draft and push has been recorded. The RFC file has not been created yet and no commit has been made for this task.

Notes:
The RFC should emphasize scalable production design, telemetry, monitoring, and rollout strategy, while explicitly treating the MVP prototype as a later execution concern.
